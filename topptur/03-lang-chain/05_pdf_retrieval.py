# MAGIC ## Advanced Retrieval With LangChain
# MAGIC Let's go over a few more complex and advanced retrieval methods with LangChain.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There is no one right way to retrieve data - it'll depend on your application so take some time to think about it before you jump in
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's have some fun
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Multi Query - Given a single user query, use an LLM to synthetically generate multiple other queries. Use each one of the new queries to retrieve documents, take the union of those documents for the final context of your prompt
# MAGIC * Contextual Compression - Fluff remover. Normal retrieval but with an extra step of pulling out relevant information from each returned document. This makes each relevant document smaller for your final prompt (which increases information density)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Maybe later:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Parent Document Retriever - Split and embed small chunks (for maximum information density), then return the parent documents (or larger chunks) those small chunks come from
# MAGIC * Ensemble Retriever - Combine multiple retrievers together
# MAGIC * Self-Query - When the retriever infers filters from a users query and applies those filters to the underlying data

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ## MultiQuery
# MAGIC This retrieval method will generated 3 additional questions to get a total of 4 queries (with the users included) that will be used to go retrieve documents. This is helpful when you want to retrieve documents which are similar in meaning to your question.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC # Get a more powerful model
# MAGIC
# MAGIC GPT-4 does support completions API, and we were not able to get sensible replies from the context,

# MAGIC ## NOT READY TODO Contextual Compression
# MAGIC Then we'll move onto contextual compression. This will take the chunk that you've made (above) and compress it's information down to the parts relevant to your query.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Say that you have a chunk that has 3 topics within it, you only really care about one of them though, this compressor will look at your query, see that you only need one of the 3 topics, then extract & return that one topic.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This one is a bit more expensive because each doc returned will get processed an additional time (to pull out the relevant data)

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import LLMChainExtractor

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md We first need to set up our compressor, it's cool that it's a separate object because that means you can use it elsewhere outside this retriever as well.

# COMMAND ----------

# llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model='gpt-4')

compressor = LLMChainExtractor.from_llm(llm)
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(base_compressor=compressor,
                                                       base_retriever=vectordb.as_retriever())

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC First, an example of compression. Below we have one of our splits that we made above

# COMMAND ----------

splits[0].page_content

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Now we are going to pass a question to it and with that question we will compress the doc. The cool part is this doc will be contextually compressed, meaning the resulting file will only have the information relevant to the question.

# COMMAND ----------

compressor.compress_documents(documents=[splits[0]], query="test for what you like to do")

# COMMAND ----------
